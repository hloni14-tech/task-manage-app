Task Management App

This project is a RESTful backend application built with Django and Django REST Framework.  
It allows users to create, update, delete, and manage tasks securely using authentication.
It allows users to create groups for multiple users.

These are the features it consists of:
* User authentication 
* CRUD operations for tasks
* Task status management
* Permissions and access control
* RESTful API endpoints

The languages I used are:
* Python
* Django
* Django REST Framework
* Git & GitHub
* PythonAnywhere (for Deployment)

The authentications:
* Users must be authenticated to create, update, or delete tasks
* Token-based authentication is used

Where the project is deployed:
